We are a Christian youth outreach group, grades 6-12. We meet every Tuesday evening at 6:30 in the
Fellowship Hall to discuss Bible based Christian values and teachings. Food is provided and all
churches are welcome to participate! If you have any questions [contact](ourleaders.md) Youth Pastor
Billy Smith.
