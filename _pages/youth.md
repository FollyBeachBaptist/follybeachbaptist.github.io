We are a Christian youth outreach group, grades 6-12. We meet every Tuesday evening at 6:30 in the
Fellowship Hall to discuss Bible based Christian values and teachings. Food is provided. All
churches are welcome to participate. If you have any questions contact Youth Pastor Billy Smith at
843-460-7737. Check us out on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/1Timothyfourtwelve).
