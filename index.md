Thank you for visiting our site.

Folly Beach Baptist Church is a fellowship of committed believers with a heart for caring and
sharing. As a popular vacation destination, we are blessed with a unique opportunity to plant
nuggets of Kingdom growth with people from all over the world. But also we are devoted to be an
anchor of hope, encouragement, and the love of God on the beach and in our neighboring communities.
We strive to minister to the whole person, meeting spiritual, emotional, and when possible, physical
needs of those who seek help.

In other words, we seek to "love the Lord our God with all our hearts, and to love our neighbors as
ourselves." After the first visit, you are FBBC family!

Please take the time to navigate through the different pages of our site to see what is offered. It
would be our privilege to minister to you and your family right where you are.

Love in Christ, Pastor Richard Summey
